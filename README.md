# COMP3000 Project - Zack Hawkins [10587295]
This is the repository for the COMP3000 individual project. I will be using unity for the development of the project throughout as well as other tools to aid with agile development and communication with my supervisor.

Supervisor: Paul Watson


# Project Layout
This project will be a procedural generation tool designed to create a city-scape. It will first generate a terrain for the buildings to sit on, then if the ground is flat enough, it will place buildings on the locations it can. This project is built to make use of pseudo-randomness that a computer can generate. It will use this to create different landscapes and cities to fill a pre-allocated area.


# Technology Used
- Throughout this project I will be primarily using [Unity](https://unity.com/) as the main software for the development of my project.
- I will also be usning [Microsoft Planner](https://tasks.office.com/) to aid with the agile development.
- To communicate with my supervisor I will be using [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software) as well as [Zoom](https://zoom.us/). This is replacing the normal contact time we would have been able to do if it weren't for COVID-19.
