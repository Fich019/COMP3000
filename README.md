# COMP3000 Project
This is the repository for the COMP3000 individual project. I will be using unity for the development of the project throughout.


# Project Layout



# Technology Used
- Throughout this project I will be primarily using [Unity](https://unity.com/) as the main software for the development of my project.
- I will also be usning [Microsoft Planner](https://tasks.office.com/) to aid with the agile development.
- To communicate with my supervisor I will be using [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software) as well as [Zoom](https://zoom.us/). This is replacing the normal contact time we would have been able to do if it weren't for COVID-19.
